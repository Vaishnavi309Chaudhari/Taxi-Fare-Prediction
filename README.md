## Introduction
Accurate taxi fare prediction can significantly enhance user experience by providing them with an estimate of the fare before starting the journey. This project leverages machine learning algorithms to predict taxi fares using historical trip data.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes historical data of taxi trips, which contains features like pickup and dropoff locations, datetime, passenger count, and fare amount.

## Features
The features in the dataset are:
- `pickup_datetime`: Timestamp of when the trip started.
- `pickup_longitude`: Longitude coordinate of the pickup location.
- `pickup_latitude`: Latitude coordinate of the pickup location.
- `dropoff_longitude`: Longitude coordinate of the dropoff location.
- `dropoff_latitude`: Latitude coordinate of the dropoff location.
- `passenger_count`: Number of passengers in the taxi.
- `fare_amount`: The fare amount in USD (target variable).
